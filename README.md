# Web Scraper

This is a web scraper for Stanislaus State's Document Migration and Document Accessibilty Audit. It accesses Stan State web pages and documents Drupal 7, Drupal 10, and SharePoint files in an Excel spreadsheet.

## To-Do

1. Pull Access Request and HTML Statements out of current functions, into its own function (maybe look into Singleton pattern)
